# PPI-Network-Analysis-Using-STRING-Database
This repository contains a Python-based tool for performing protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using the STRING database. The code identifies critical genes based on their node degrees in the interaction network, making it useful for biological researchers analyzing gene interactions in various contexts.
