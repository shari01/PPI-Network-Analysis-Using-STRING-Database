This project enables researchers to analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the STRING database. The script processes a list of genes, retrieves interaction data, builds a network, and identifies important genes based on their connectivity (node degree). It is particularly useful for identifying hub genes that play a crucial role in biological networks.
